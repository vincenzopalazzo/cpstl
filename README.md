Competitive programming standard library (CPSTL) is a repository with a
collection of data structure and algorithms in many different languages.
The object of this library (copy and past code) is to offer and complete tested
and well developed data structure to resolve the competitive programming problem or
simple to prepare code interview in some company.

## Introduction

## Language supported 
 
- [X] C++14
  - [Algorithms and Data structure](https://vincenzopalazzo.github.io/cpstl/cpp)
  - [Test tools](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/cpstl/tree/master/cpp/utils/test)


## Contribute
The repository is open to receive contribution to improve solutions or the quality of the repository, there are only a few rules to respect that are reported below.

- Each code that is inside the repository need to follow the good formatted code guide lines, so if the solution uses the C++ classes the Google code style need to be included in the solution. clang-format file available at the following link, otherwise is the C++ is without classes a Linux Kernel guide lines need to be included clang-format file available at the following link.
New implementation of datastructure need to be push also in repository cpstl.

- Each solution, need to contains a Readme with some details about the implementation and the time execution on the online Judge, one example can be the following solution

- The support of new programming languages need to be discussed with a new issue in this repository to discuss the line guide about the code style.
